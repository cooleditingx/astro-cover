    <h1>Solar Eclipses Mechanisms</h1>
    <p>A solar eclipse happens when the Moon gets in the way of the Sun's light and casts its shadow on Earth. That means during the day, the Moon moves over the Sun and it gets dark.</p>
    <p>However, the Moon is about 400 times smaller than the Sun. How can it block all of that light?</p>
    <p>It all has to do with the distance between Earth and the Sun and Earth and the Moon.
        Even though the Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun, it's also about 400 times closer to Earth than the Sun is. This means that from Earth, the Moon and the Sun appear to be roughly the same size in the sky.</p>
        
    <p>So, when the Moon comes between Earth and the Sun during a total solar eclipse, the Moon appears to completely cover up the light from the Sun.</p>
    <p>However, total solar eclipses won't be forever
      The Moon's orbit is changing. In fact, the Moon's orbit grows about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) larger every year. As the Moon's orbit takes it farther and farther away from Earth, the Moon will appear smaller and smaller in our sky.</p>
    <p>This occasionally happens now. The Moon's orbit isn't perfectly round. That means that sometimes the Moon is slightly farther away from Earth than it is at other times. Sometimes the Moon is far enough away that it doesn't create a total solar eclipse. In this case, the Moon obscures most of the Sun, but a thin ring of the Sun remains visible around the Moon.
        However, once the Moon's growing orbit takes it approximately 14,600 miles (23,500 km) farther away from Earth, it will always be too far away to completely cover the Sun. That won't happen for a long time though. If the Moon's orbit grows only 1.5 inches every year, it will take more than 600 million years for total solar eclipses to completely disappear!</p>

    <h1 class="two">Lunar Eclipses Mechanisms</h1>
    <p>During a lunar eclipse, Earth gets in the way of the Sun's light hitting the Moon. That means that during the night, a full moon fades away as Earth's shadow covers it up.
        The Moon can also look reddish because Earth's atmosphere absorbs the other colors while it bends some sunlight toward the Moon. Sunlight bending through the atmosphere and absorbing other colors is also why sunsets are orange and red.</p>

        <p ><strong>What is an eclipse season and why do they occur approximately every six months?</strong></p>
        <p >During the new moon, the Moon usually passes below or above the Sun, and its shadow misses Earth.</p><p> There are only two times a year, called “eclipse seasons,” when the new moon crosses the Earth-Sun (ecliptic) plane and provides opportunities for solar eclipses.</p>
        <p >Eclipses occur at approximately six-month intervals due to the alignment of the Moon's orbit with Earth's orbit around the Sun. Here's why:</p>
        <p >● The Moon's Path: The Moon's path around Earth is slightly tilted compared to Earth's orbit around the Sun, known as the ecliptic plane, with a tilt of about 5.1 degrees.</p>
        <p >● Nodes: The points where the Moon's path crosses the ecliptic plane are called lunar nodes, consisting of the ascending node (where the Moon moves from below to above the ecliptic) and the descending node (where it moves from above to below).</p>
        <p >● Alignment for Eclipses: Eclipses can only occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon align in a specific manner. A solar eclipse requires a new moon (Moon between Earth and Sun) near one of the lunar nodes. For a lunar eclipse, a full moon (Earth between Moon and Sun) must be close to a lunar node.</p>
        <p >● Precession: Over time, the Earth's axis undergoes gradual changes due to precession, causing the positions of the lunar nodes to slowly shift over the years.</p>
